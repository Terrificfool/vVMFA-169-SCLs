# vVMFA-169-SCLs

Install the .lua files to your Saved Games\DCS\MissionEditor\UnitPayloads\ folder. 

NOTE: this will override your existing loadouts for these modules. The default DCS loadouts aren't worth much, but in the future we may create a script that auto-merges the SCLs with your existing loadouts to avoid losing any personal settings.
